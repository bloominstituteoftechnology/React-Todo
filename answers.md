### All Answers to Partner Study should be filled out in this file.
* 1. Single Page Application: Single-Page-Applications are web apps that react with the user in a dynamic way by rewriting the current page without loading the entire new page form a server.

* 2. Compilers: Compilers take a JavaScript code and transform it into browser understandable format.

* 3. Bundlers: Bundlers are used to combine CSS and JavaScript written in a sperate module into a few files to make web optimization effective.

* 4. Elements: Elements are an object representation of a DOM node. i.e. a React element describes what we wanted to see on the screen.

* 5. Components: Components are functions or classes that return a React element. In other words, they are constituents of React.

* 7. Package managers: Package managers manages package dependencies. It helps you install new packages when you need to  use them. Like if you want to start using math package for example you say: npm install math. It then downloads files for that package. Then you can start using math package.

* 8. CDN: CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. Its like a cache of static/immutable data like images. These images are copied in multiple locations. When a user accesses a page that has such image, the image is fetched from closest CDN location. This helps reduce the latency of fetching such large static content and hence the latency to completely render webpages.

* 9. Props: There are two types of data that control a component:Props and State. Props are readonly inputs to a React component. They cannot be modified in any way throughout its lifetime. Props are passed from parent component to the child component.

* 10. State: State is used for the data component that needs to be changed. State is managed by the component itself. Components should be defined as classes in order to have its state.
